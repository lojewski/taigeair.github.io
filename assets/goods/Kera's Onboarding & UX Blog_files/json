Many people know the importance of doing usability studies but not so many are able to do it well. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Similar to me, many developers, designers, and product managers fell into this UX role and had to learn it themselves. It&#8217;s taken me a while to learn how to conduct effective, valuable user testing so I thought I&#8217;d write a guide and checklist for those who don&#8217;t do this as their full-time job or just starting out.<\/p>\n<p><strike><strong>Basic Idea of Usability Study<\/strong><\/strike><\/p>\n<p>If something isn&#8217;t performing well, you have to go be a detective and figure out why. That&#8217;s the essence of doing user testing.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>This is something I really enjoy doing because as a product owner, you always want to build the best product possible and there&#8217;s nothing like watching real people use your product. For my <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wellingtonstravel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">maps business<\/a><span>, I literally stood in the retail stores and watched how people responded to the product: if they noticed the product, how they responded to it, how they decided whether or not to buy, why they bought it, etc.\u00a0<\/span><span>It&#8217;s like being a modern-day Sherlock Holmes but less dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Recently, I performed a usability test for our latest product, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kera.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">the Get Started Widget<\/a> and will use examples from it.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strike><strong>Reasons to do a Usability Test<\/strong><\/strike><\/p>\n<p>The main benefits of doing web usability testing are<\/p>\n<ul><li><span>You get unfiltered and high bandwidth feedback<\/span><\/li>\n<li>You can see how users think and points of confusion<\/li>\n<li>You get to figure out the why<\/li>\n<li>You feel like Sherlock Holmes<\/li>\n<\/ul><p><br\/>Usability testing is a qualitative method of research which is much better suited for answering question about why or how to fix a problem. Quantitative methods such as A\/B testing do a much better job answering how many and how much questions. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/which-ux-research-methods\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nielsen Norman Group<\/a> has a great article on which user experience research methods to use.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Aside: If your company has a support team, the team lead should be involved with user experience in general because those people really understand the pain of the customer and can often provide ideas and suggestions to vastly improve the product.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For example, at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wimdu.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wimdu<\/a> we were missing out on signups because of our Facebook Connect design. We didn&#8217;t know this but we confused some users into thinking we required Facebook in order to sign up. People actually called in to try to figure out how to sign up without Facebook. We fixed this with by adding a horizontal rule with the word &#8220;or&#8221; between the sign up methods. That ceased those types of support calls.<\/p>\n<p><strike>Step 1. Planning (1-3 hours)<\/strike><\/p>\n<p><span><strong>Have an objective(s).<\/strong> Why are you doing this study?

Although it is recommend to have one, I have often been really successful without one especially early on. Sometimes product challenges are so difficult, you need to do research just to get a hunch. In this case, keep an open mind and just watch users and take in what is happening without any bias to prove or disprove.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively,\u00a0<span>you may want to conduct a<\/span><span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.usability.gov\/methods\/test_refine\/heuristic.html\" target=\"_blank\">heuristic evaluation<\/a><span>, a review by a usability expert of your UI against accepted heuristics,\u00a0to generate some\u00a0hypotheses.

(And I&#8217;m pretty sure all good spies use recording equipment.) If you&#8217;re not recording, figure out how to take good notes. If you&#8217;re collecting quantitive data, prepare a form or table to help you quickly take notes and stay organised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Get the people.\u00a0<\/strong><span>Ideally you&#8217;ll have a pool of candidates to ask to come in for a usability study.

(yes\/no) Great, just to give you an idea of how this works. We&#8217;ll be asking you to take a look at our website and asking you some questions. Then we&#8217;ll get you to try our application to perform some tasks. It should take about 25 minutes in total. We&#8217;re going to be testing the web application to see if it is understandable and usable. We&#8217;re not testing you. There are no right or wrong answers.<\/p>\n<br\/><p>Intro to Marketing Site Analysis:<\/p>\n<p>Say a friend has sent you a link to this site.

(After finding out participant was a history major). I&#8217;m going to give you a <strong>scenario<\/strong>. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a project manager for a museum&#8217;s website that has users. You want your users to be more engaged and active so someone has\u00a0recommended that you take a look at this site. You have developer resources but you&#8217;re going to take a look first and evaluate it because you&#8217;re responsible for this project.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I highly recommend watching this short video on how to run in-person experiments on <a href=\"https:\/\/class.coursera.org\/hci\/lecture\/36\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford&#8217;s HCI course<\/a>\u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/134040586\/Slides-PDF-HCI-10-1-RunningLabExperiments\" target=\"_blank\">slides<\/a>) and this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QckIzHC99Xc\" target=\"_blank\">Zipcar usability test example<\/a>. If the videos are no longer available you can still find them in my shared <a href=\"https:\/\/www.box.com\/taigeair-usability-toolkit\" target=\"_blank\">Usability Toolkit folder<\/a> on Box below.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, collect information on the participant and get them to fill out any paperwork if necessary (i.e. contact info, demographic data, consent, NDA, etc.). Many templates are in the Usability Toolkit folder at the end.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Observing and taking notes.<\/strong>\u00a0Observing the user is one of the main benefits of in-person experiments.\u00a0Watch users as they attempt to perform tasks with the user interface.\u00a0Collect quantitive data on task completion. Record interesting findings. Log points of confusion. Steps users took to complete a task or to explore\/navigate your website. Note what users were looking at and what they ignored.

Take a guess.<\/p>\n<p>What do you want to click on now?<\/p>\n<p>What do you want to know now?<\/p>\n<p>Why did you do that?<\/p>\n<p><span>What are you thinking?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>What do you think this is?

It&#8217;s similar to asking questions to get to why but here the user is talking aloud as he or she is performing the task uninterrupted. You&#8217;d need to teach the user how to think aloud first. I usually say something like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As you\u2019re doing the task, I want you to say aloud whatever you are thinking. For example, if I am thinking aloud (take a pen), I\u2019d say: I see this pen. It has a blue cap so I assume the ink will be blue. It looks like I can just pull it off so I\u2019ll try to pull it. Great, it worked.\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Or see 8:25 of the <a href=\"https:\/\/class.coursera.org\/hci\/lecture\/36\" target=\"_blank\">in-person experiment video<\/a> to see a Stanford professor do it.<\/p>\n<p>Often this is hard for a user so you&#8217;d need to revert back to prompting the user or asking questions to get the why. Remember: participants who think aloud will be slower at performing tasks and may behave differently.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Debrief the participant.<\/strong>\u00a0This is the time when you can 1. inform them about the purpose of study if you couldn&#8217;t before 2. get them fill out paper survey\u00a0questionnaires\u00a0and 3. get them to sign a receipt\u00a0of remuneration.<\/p>\n<p><strike>Step 4. Summarising and Presenting Findings. (2-5 hours)<\/strike><\/p>\n<p><strong>Refining notes.<\/strong> Right after each participant, take the time to write down all your observations and particularities while they are still fresh in your mind. Quickly check the notes you made during the study to see if they can be understood later on and convert to long-form if necessary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aggregate findings and performing\u00a0calculations.\u00a0<\/strong>You&#8217;ll get an idea of the most critical discoveries which will drive your report. Compile all the\u00a0qualitative\u00a0findings into main\u00a0takeaways,\u00a0citing numbers or percentages to indicate importance. Do the same\u00a0with\u00a0quantitive data. Perform\u00a0calculations\u00a0as need. Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.measuringusability.com\/calc.php\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> with many useful\u00a0calculators for usability testing.\u00a0<span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Reporting findings<\/strong>. Summarise the goal, participant characteristics, results, and recommendations. The report depends on the scale of the project and your audience. If it&#8217;s a small study for your startup, it can be relatively informal. If it&#8217;s for a client, you might need to package your presentation accordingly. Here are <a href=\"http:\/\/jcflowers1.iweb.bsu.edu\/rlo\/reportingusability.htm\" target=\"_blank\">some tips<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Presenting.<\/strong>\u00a0It&#8217;s great to give a presentation to the team in person so you can be sure you&#8217;re communicating the findings effectively. You can also take this time to answer questions, discuss the implications, and brainstorm improvements or follow-on studies together.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strike><span>Final Thoughts<\/span><\/strike><\/p>\n<p>You might want to outsource this. While I enjoy doing it in-house and being close to users, there are definitely companies that specialise in UX and conduct great usability\u00a0tests. A couple relatively cheap and easy to use ones are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youeye.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">YouEye<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usertesting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">usertesting.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>To me, data without reason is just noise.

They solved a logistical problem first - taking the pain out of distributing information about your startup to interested investors.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span>And once AngelList tipped with startups, it was only a matter of time before investors followed in droves. Because after all, that\u2019s what investors do best :)<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strike><span>Angel List Onboarding Goals<\/span><\/strike><\/p>\n<p><span>I would bet dollars to doughnuts that Angel List\u2019s criteria for activation is the act of publishing a startup profile. But much like Linkedin, simply publishing a profile isn\u2019t enough. The key is publishing a <\/span><em>complete<\/em><span> profile.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span>So what, specifically, are they looking for, and how do they get users there?<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span>An Angel List profile can be separated into three main sections: Basic information (name, logo, location, etc), adding your team (founders, employees, professional services, advisors, customers, etc), and lastly, the more advanced profile information (financial numbers, deck, product information, press mentions, etc).<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span>Essentially, activating on AngelList means completing a very complex form. And so my gut says the biggest activation challenge isn\u2019t learning how to use the software - most likely it\u2019s creating the content and having your team agree on it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><strike><span>Angel List Onboarding Conventions<\/span><\/strike><\/p>\n\n<p><span><em>Wizard Pattern<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>From a UX perspective, Angel List is using the Wizard Pattern to guide users through the onboarding process, starting with the easiest information and moving to the most complex information. The first section of the wizard the basic company info, the second section is the team section, and then they send you to your actual profile to fill in the advanced information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/b689c7648affd3de18fb5c5922852b5e\/tumblr_inline_mky9toP1G31qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p><em>Empty State Micro-Copy<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span>When you\u2019re looking at an empty section of your Angel List profile, they show you some micro-copy that gives you hints on what to include. For example, underneath of the Images &amp; Video section, the micro-copy reads, \u201cShow off your product. Screenshots are the fastest way to show what you\u2019re building. Video walkthroughs of the product or pitch are too in-depth.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/dbca15bd8d0127291671888d1a2c15a6\/tumblr_inline_mky9w6daeI1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Section Specific ToolTips<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span>For the more complex profile information, Angel List implemented tool tips with concrete examples. These are the types of questions that can really slow you down, so having specific examples shrinks the challenge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/4f6d076f2975a5c25d231f9d9fe32feb\/tumblr_inline_mky9yggZqh1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p><em>Profile Completeness<\/em><span><br\/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>At first I didn\u2019t think that Angel List had a profile completeness feature, but it turns out they do, tucked away in the dashboard. There are a series of three \u201ctips\u201d next to the progress bar, and when you click on one of the tips, they jump to the appropriate URL.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/30e76d7fc003cf9612cf2be819586fde\/tumblr_inline_mky9zwG66z1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p><strike><span>Strengths<\/span><\/strike><\/p>\n<ol><li>\n<p><span>Good use of Wizard Pattern - this is a convention we also use, and it\u2019s interesting to see how they include the easier information first, moving on to the more complex information later. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><span>In-line Edit State - 9 - It\u2019s really nice that you don\u2019t have to go to a separate page to edit a section of your profile. Rather, when you click an edit button, the section changes into a different state that lets you edit on the fly. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Profile Completeness - If you can find it, the profile completeness widget is an effective and motivating guide.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strike><span>Areas of Opportunity<\/span><\/strike><\/p>\n<ol><li>\n<p><span>It\u2019s hard to tell what the priority of the sections are. I think this is key when you\u2019re presented with such a large amount of content to produce. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><span>I think there\u2019s an opportunity for Angel List to explicitly communicate the benefits of a complete profile. Are my chances better of receiving investor interest? <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><span>In order to increase motivation and feedback, it would be good to raise the prominence of the profile completeness widget.

This idea that by decreasing your font size you can get careful reading instead of scanning stemmed from a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.directcreative.com\/blog\/eye-tracking-websites\" target=\"_blank\">eye tracking study article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From Direct Creative:<\/p>\n<div><br\/><p>5.

Larger type promotes scanning rather than reading.<\/p>\n<br\/><p>Be careful with this one. No one is suggesting you shrink your web type to make it barely legible. I think the takeaway is to avoid making your type too big if you want close reading and avoid making it too small if you want to communicate rapidly.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>So on March 21, we changed our font size from\u00a019px\u00a0to\u00a016px.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I compared visitor activity on our blog from Apr. 5 - \u00a0Mar. 22nd (&#8220;after group&#8221;) and from Mar. 7th - Mar. 21st (&#8220;before group&#8221;).

There the &#8220;before&#8221; time was vastly more than the &#8220;after&#8221;. Since the &#8220;average\u00a0time on page&#8221; figure averages the time across all visits and is not weighted by post, a hit post with a lot of traffic one day can\u00a0significantly\u00a0skew the data.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;d be better\u00a0methodology\u00a0if the average time on site was averaged per blog post and then averaged again to get the overall change. This would reduce the effects of outliers.<\/p>\n<p>If you look at the graph after that anomaly, it seems the &#8220;after&#8221; time is roughly on par with or slightly above the &#8220;before&#8221;. I don&#8217;t believe there is any real\u00a0significance\u00a0here worth further testing though.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Bounce rate measures how engaging your content is and if someone leaves your site without looking at another page. Since I don&#8217;t have good reason to believe decreasing the font size will decrease bounce rate, I&#8217;ll use a two-tailed test. Running the 2-tailed t-test on the numbers showed a p-value of 0.101 which isn&#8217;t very\u00a0significant. Since the p-value (0.101) is greater than the significance level (0.05), we accept the null hypothesis that the two proportions are equal.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, going from font size 19px to 16px in the Mercury typeface didn&#8217;t produce any real benefits.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;-<\/p>\n<p>Taige Zhang is a Product Marketer at Kera.

Originally from Vancouver, the team is currently in San Francisco, and I was introduced to their CEO, Amin, through a mutual friend.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Amin was interested in Kera, so I created a 7geese account to see exactly what they were up to before we talked. I was really impressed with their first-time-user-experience, so I wanted to share it here.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When you first login to 7geese, you see a \u201cprofile completeness\u201d widget.

In other words, this is the minimum set of features that must be used for a user to receive value from 7geese. If a user completes these four steps, they&#8217;ll be more likely to convert into a paying customer.<\/p>\n<p>This is effective because it gets you to create an emotional connection between you and the app, makes you commit to using it, and gives you a reason to come back - All within the first five minutes of logging in.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strike>The Breakdown<\/strike><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/366e42b2cd70c6b96b45cefa46c6073a\/tumblr_inline_mklhdgbj6q1qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p>First, I clicked on the \u201cAdd a profile photo\u201d link, which took me to the profile page. When I uploaded a photo and returned to the homepage, I saw that I was 25% complete.

When I clicked on the title of the task in the widget, it opened up a modal that allowed me to invite others. This is smart because it sucks another person into the app. Once you invite someone else to join, you feel compelled to take action and recognize them.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>By this point I was really motivated to complete my profile, so I created my first objective. This is a slightly more challenging task than adding a profile photo, so they\u2019re using guiders.js to walk their users through the workflow.

This position is optimal because it&#8217;s not vital information but important enough that your users will see it (and hopefully get to it). \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>By the way if you&#8217;re interested in positioning for usability, here are some great resources on better web design through eyeball tracking studies:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.usability.gov\/articles\/newsletter\/pubs\/032010news.html\" target=\"_blank\">Usability.gov<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.directcreative.com\/blog\/eye-tracking-websites\" target=\"_blank\">DirectCreative<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"http:\/\/nichcy.org\/dissemination\/tools\/webwriting\/reading\" target=\"_blank\">Nichcy.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/4626a84c104e2a3f534e69dba123d192\/tumblr_inline_mjz3keuVHG1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strike>The Completion Meter<\/strike><\/p>\n<p>Google Plus named its completion meter &#8220;Complete Your Profile&#8221; which gives meaning to the progress bar and also issues a firm command. It shows percentage of profile completed. It also presents a single task you can do to boost your profile. In this case, it&#8217;s adding a school.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/e926d71db6e7f155c2e4a133dee75768\/tumblr_inline_mjyrr9Q7V81qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strike>Freedom of Choice<\/strike><\/p>\n<p>There are two arrows that allow you to do another task if you don&#8217;t want to add a school. This is a great affordance because as a user, if I really don&#8217;t want to add a school, then I&#8217;ll be forever stuck.<\/p>\n<p>This is akin to presenting multiple missions in a game that gives the user freedom to choose. However, due to space constraints, they are not shown, unless the arrows are clicked.<\/p>\n<p><strike>Widget Permanence\u00a0<\/strike><\/p>\n<p>If you click on the X, the progress bar will be removed from your profile forever! I am not sure how to get the progress bar back. It&#8217;s interesting companies like Box and Google choose to allow users to remove the progress bar (and making it impossible to undo), while companies like OKCupid and LinkedIn make the progress bar perpetual.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>I can understand progress bars can cause stress and tension for the user which is why they allow users to remove them but users also want to find out about cool features and get the most out of the app. What happens when I want to have it back? There should definitely be a way to get back on track.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s Profile Strength Indicator persists even after you reach 100%; while some companies such as Dropbox and 7Geese remove their progress bars after users have onboarded.\u00a0<span>This makes sense once you&#8217;re onboarded, there&#8217;s no need to provide you with missions anymore. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>The progress bar is the cocoon of a butterfly.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strike>Adding Missions<\/strike><\/p>\n<p><span>However, in the case of games additional value may be provided by releasing new missions. Some games have a notification centre that can be inbox-zero but you will see a badge every time a new mission is available.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re all used to that because Facebook does the same thing to get us to check messages which are game-like in that they can be to-do items. Like missions.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/272cc9e218344999d6ae2734f1a4b993\/tumblr_inline_mjyvvluyF81qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p>In the case of onboard-once web apps, perhaps there are no plans for future missions so there&#8217;s no reason to condition the user to associate that part of the UI with new missions.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>New missions should not be presented as a progress bar because that would mean taking away progress from the user.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/larifari.org\/blog\/need-to-complete\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Liu <\/a><span>of MIT Media Lab and hunch.com states: &#8220;Progress bars must only advance, and never move back.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Perhaps the need to add missions without retracting progress is why LinkedIn changed from a completion meter to a profile strength badge. Or maybe it was a design choice or based on research people preferred filling out a circle better than a bar or it was more fun to give ranks. Maybe it&#8217;s a combination but my hunch is that LinkedIn wants to introduce new missions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/a7ec36cd8566dc588e96ef3af3253a18\/tumblr_inline_mjyvao8GdG1qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n<p><strike>Google Plus Missions<\/strike><\/p>\n<p>If you choose to accept a mission, in this case, add a school, you&#8217;ll see a modal that helps you complete your profile. This makes it a lot easier, seamless, and more fun than taking you to a standard page where you could provide the information.<\/p>\n<p>This is the standard edit profile page it doesn&#8217;t take you to.<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/30722338aabd7f8a3dae9b9b2b351dd2\/tumblr_inline_mjytzvLv4E1qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p><strike><span>The Mission Modal<\/span><\/strike><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/cc3e7dd1c0cbbbdb48971d19b907a4de\/tumblr_inline_mjyvbyiNPY1qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p>This is excellent because once you get started with filling out your school. You&#8217;re in the filling-out-stuff state. What better time to give you more similar, uncompleted tasks? Google would love to get you to complete all that\u00a0information.<\/p>\n<p>Like Tetris, Google loads it on.<\/p>\n<p><strike>Discussion<\/strike><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m curious what results Google achieved with this.

Hook<\/em> - The purpose of the hook is to arouse the audience&#8217;s attention and interest. DataSift does this by launching you into an <em>interactive tutorial.\u00a0<\/em>It&#8217;s very powerful because it is engaging the user and getting the user involved. Similar to the famous and often cited <a href=\"http:\/\/www.knewton.com\/blog\/knewton\/inside-knewton\/2012\/02\/06\/ux-corner-5-great-onboarding-examples\/\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy hook<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Grade: A+<\/p>\n<p><span><em>2. Problem and Pain Explained<\/em> - In the famous book <\/span><span><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/1565114205?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393185&amp;creativeASIN=1565114205&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=torontot-20\" target=\"_blank\">SPIN Selling by Neil Rackham<\/a><span>, one of the main messages is the importance of drawing out implied need and asking the right questions to develop the seriousness of the problem before offering a solution. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>From the book:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the central purpose of Implication Questions in larger sales. They take a problem that the buyer perceives to be small and build it up into a problem large enough to justify action.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>There have been many occasions when we&#8217;ve been talking to decision makers after a call and heard them comment\u00a0favourably\u00a0on salespeople who asked them Implication Questions, saying\u00a0things\u00a0like &#8220;that person talked my\u00a0language\u00a0&#8221; Implications are the language of decision makers, and if you can talk their language, you&#8217;ll\u00a0influence\u00a0them better.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>DataSift doesn&#8217;t spend much time\u00a0emphasising\u00a0the pain or empathising\u00a0with users initially but if you go into their plans and industry section, you&#8217;ll see some of this technique. From their plans page:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m a small business or start up with under 250 employees looking for a certified data partner that can aggregate many social sources and can help me target social users by sophisticated filters.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>This is DataSift&#8217;s weakest area. It can be improved by better conveying its knowledge of the customer&#8217;s pain.<\/p>\n<p>Grade: B+<\/p>\n<p><em>3. Top Level Picture<\/em> - DataSift quickly explains it is a social data platform in its video. It also clearly states what it&#8217;s about on its home page with this line:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DataSift is the leading platform for building applications with insights derived from the most popular social networks and news sources.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not in the sector, it still might be confusing what that sentence means. There&#8217;s some business speak in there, but taking a quick tour or watching the video\u00a0clarifies\u00a0a lot.<\/p>\n<p>Grade: A<\/p>\n<p><em>4. 3 Key Benefits Explained<\/em> - It&#8217;s best to only include 3 key benefits because that&#8217;s the optimal number to be able to persuade and still be retained. Once you end up on their trial page. You&#8217;re hit with the 3 key persuasive arguments. My interpretation of their benefits:<\/p>\n<ol><li>Unlocks value in your data<\/li>\n<li>Works with your existing BI products<\/li>\n<li>Scalable\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ol><p>Copy could be better though.<\/p>\n<p>Grade: A<\/p>\n<p><em>5. Social Proof &amp; Partners<\/em> - Customer evidence is one of the most powerful tools in marketing. Showing off your customers and partners provides trust and reduces perceived risks. DataSift has a lot of coverage from notable news publications such as Bloomberg, TechCrunch, and Forbes. It&#8217;s also a Twitter partner. However, not showing which companies are using its platform is a shortcoming.<\/p>\n<p>Grade: A-<\/p>\n<p><em><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/4d9140541f992da517a216a7a36184a0\/tumblr_inline_miy5dfjyCp1qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>6. Multimedia &amp; Video<\/em> - Videos are vital to communication and <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/product-videos-conversion\/\" target=\"_blank\">conversion<\/a>. You need multimedia to keep the visitor interested and engaged in your messaging. Furthermore, there are 3 types of learners: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. DataSift engages all of the learning types. DataSift has a pretty decent video explaining their product with audio and visuals. They also use an interactive tutorial that gets the hand-on visitor trying the tool without needing to sign up!\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Grade: A+<\/p>\n<p>7. <em>Use Cases<\/em> - Uses cases makes it clear to the visitor how the product can be valuable in their lives. This is where DataSift excels. They go into industries and spell out the value for the visitor.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/990d5ec079294d7a167b86b6ad7c83f5\/tumblr_inline_miy4n7iZxC1qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p>For example, finance.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/go.bloomberg.com\/tech-deals\/2012-11-13-datasift-raises-15-million-to-help-traders-mine-twitter-posts\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg<\/a><span>:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since DataSift introduced a product for financial firms in September, customers have been using the software to gain insight into sentiment around companies ranging from Facebook to Research In Motion, and determine how that influences stocks or correlates with price movements, said Rob Bailey, DataSift\u2019s chief executive officer.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Grade: A+<\/p>\n<p>8.<em> Calls to Action<\/em> - Having multiple calls to action is great. Using different copy for calls to action is excellent.

However, to our surprise, the majority of our early signups were not exclusively the engineers and designers we expected. Instead we were pleased to welcome users from the front lines. Marketing, support, customer success and others in-between arrived seeking an innovative platform to boost conversions and reduce churn. The only trouble was that up to now, most of those excited signups haven&#8217;t been able to use Kera without support from their product teams \u2013 resources that are so often tough to come by.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Those users came to the right place, but Kera wasn&#8217;t their size. In response to this learning we&#8217;ve spent the last while working on a platform for non-technical users. Large, complex tools have been distilled into a simple, tidy interface that we&#8217;re excited to be releasing in the coming weeks. This new interface for authoring and editing Kera walkthroughs will be distributed as a Chrome extension, a light and versatile way for you to experiment with Kera and rapidly learn how we can add real value to your business.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/86335efd17cf0418b46d97f4f5cac9bb\/tumblr_inline_mi9rgmxmQV1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/455f57c95742f1bbebda67075b1cd976\/tumblr_inline_mi9rj0c3mc1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/8d665ff82597b80ede9361f780ab58f2\/tumblr_inline_mi9rjdHIoY1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/9f19af4eee73ca0e2d1642680a0ed57f\/tumblr_inline_mi9rp9a2Sg1qz4rgp.jpg\"\/><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The first release of the Kera Editor includes the following:<\/p>\n<ul><li><span>Interface layered over your website or application<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Author step-by-step walkthroughs with basic events* and subtitles<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Rapidly sketch and refine walkthroughs by interacting directly with your website or application<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Toggle a walkthrough&#8217;s status from draft to live<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Edit and delete your walkthroughs<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><p class=\"p1\">What you won&#8217;t be able to do (yet\u2026)<\/p>\n<ul><li><span>Upload or record audio<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Add advanced events**<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Sync events to an audio timeline<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Instrument analytics for your walkthroughs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span>Monitor walkthrough analytics<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul><p class=\"p1\">* Basic events include click, move, click here, type here, dropdown here<br\/><span>** Advanced events include pause, input_change, eval_javascript and others<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Limitations? Sure, there&#8217;s lots of them. But, as always, speedy shipping trumps feature spoils. We wanted to get a non-technical authoring\/editing interface in your hands as soon as possible. So try it out, tell us your story and help us make sure the features in the next releases of Kera are exactly what you need to succeed.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While this is only the first step, the Kera team is very excited to connect you, our users, with the tools you&#8217;ve been asking for. It may still be a bit rough around the edges, but it ought to get you off to a good start. For the next few weeks the Kera Editor extension will only be available to a small, closed group.

We and our homies use tutorial.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Tutorials?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We use tutorial because it sounds active. A game tutorial is something that helps you learn the UI and game play, matching level to difficulty. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lynda.com\" target=\"_blank\">Lynda<\/a>\u00a0is one of the best teaching and training platforms and they use the word tutorial.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/f416446d0e9e2d1b4fea9743a8784bcd\/tumblr_inline_mi4juzjfos1qz4rgp.png\"\/><\/p>\n\n<p>A walkthrough is more of a demonstration and overview - &#8220;here, let me walk you through our website. Let me give you a tour.&#8221; As opposed to tutorials where you learn something specific.

(Good to know my high school hasn&#8217;t changed their schedule much).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span>A walkthrough is more of a lecture where the professor talks and you try to take it in. Codecademy is a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial<\/a><span>. This is a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/strategywiki.org\/wiki\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue\/Pallet_Town\" target=\"_blank\">walkthrough<\/a><span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re positioning ourselves as a tutorial company. We want to grow with the users. We give the user more advanced tasks as the user becomes more skilled.
