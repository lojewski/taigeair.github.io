<p>This is my biggest complaint about Siri on iOS 7. I thought it’d be fixed by now but it doesn’t seem anyone cares or Apple isn’t hearing this feedback.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with iOS7 is that Siri covers your screen completely when it’s listening to you. This is immensely user unfriendly for me. </p>
<p>Many times I’ll tell Siri to call a number I’m reading either as an image on a website or even text that can’t be clicked. Or I’ll need to tell Siri some address I need to map to but when it’s listening it renders the screen useless.</p>

<p>I really don’t understand why Apple did this. Sure, translucency is cool and hip, but this is so unhelpful. There’s not even a way to turn this off.</p>
<p>Still waiting for a solution. Even this would be better. I hope I don’t need a smart watch just to read off my screen and talk to Siri at the same time.</p>
