<h3>Teaching as a hobby.</h3>

Okay, so you're an unemployed liberal arts graduate who also enjoys correcting English grammar in the comments section or a factory worker who got replaced by a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRg_1j-iWFU" target="_blank">robot</a> or a professional who got supplanted by a piece of software. 

Do you have something you're good at such as kungfu, piano, or tennis? You can teach it and will probably really enjoy it.

<h3>Finding what you're good at.</h3>

First you need to figure out what you're good at and people are willing to pay for. I bet you're thinking, well I don't have any special skills or nutin'. Well, let me tell you this -- don't count yourself out of being special. You might not have any special skills or no nothin' but if there's one thing you're good at it's communicating in that one and only language you've known your whole life. English. They say 10,000 hours is what you need to be good at something. And you've probably had 10k hours of English schooling and practice. (It's 4 years.)

Sure it doesn't seem special to you. Heck, even homeless people ask you for money in English, right? Unless, it's those special ops ones that go around handing out cards to everyone and then comes back and collects those cards. They're the best. But in any case my point is, it doesn't seem that special but in places like China or Japan speaking English is actually considered a coveted "skill". <a href="http://www.topshop.com/" target="_blank">Top Shop</a> might not seem that special on Oxford Street but it is in NYC. 

So maybe it's time you to take that one thing you're good at besides walking, eating (sure you drop food and bite your inner-cheek sometimes but come on, even Kobe can't hit every free throw), drinking (non alcoholic drinks), and sleeping -- I wonder if you can get paid for those -- and be that English teacher!

<h3>Woah. Is it that easy to teach English?</h3>

No. There are some minimum qualifications you must have. Here is a list of things you need to have if you want to make some money while feeling superior to foreigners.

A face. You need a face. I have heard people teaching English with a ridiculously good hand puppet before but those are rare. Steve Jobs rare. My recommendation is get a face, definitely worth the investment. I've found it an extremely valuable to have one for user profiles and Skyping.

Access to the internet. Do you have an internet connection on your phone? At home? A library or Starbucks? Congrats, you have internet access!

A certification. Do you have something to back up the fact you're good at English? Do you have a law degree? A Ph.D in anything involving words? I don't know if a GED or high school diploma will suffice but I guess if you lower your rate, you still can find some students. I once rented out some floor on airbnb for cheap, real cheap. If you're a perfectionist, you may want to get certified. <a href="http://www.tesol.org/enhance-your-career/career-development/beginning-your-career/common-qualifications-for-english-language-teachers" target="_blank">TESOL</a> lists some common certification such as the TEFL Certificate.

<h3>Getting your pupils.</h3>

Get in touch or make a posting at a language school
Teach at an English language school
Go to a language exchange party (in India they have a saying, "the big fish eats the small fish")
Make a poster and stick it on things
Create a facebook page or website promoting your services
Tell your social network you're teaching English and let the referrals come to you

<h3>Teaching skills and more.</h3>

You need to stay organised as a teacher. You need to start a spreadsheet of all your students so you can remember their progress and make notes on each lesson you guys have. It can be really short but you want to deliver value and good service to your pupils so always keep a record. 

It also helps if you make another spreadsheet for your own learnings. What teaching tricks or epiphanies did you have during your lesson? Write it down so you can use it with your next student. 

Lastly, enjoy your referrals. There's nothing quite like the feeling of someone climbing a really, really high mountain or travelling extremely far to learn from you. The day you meet a complete stranger who comes up to you and says "I've heard many a great things about you. I've come to learn English from you, master" will be a great day. It will be a glorious day.
