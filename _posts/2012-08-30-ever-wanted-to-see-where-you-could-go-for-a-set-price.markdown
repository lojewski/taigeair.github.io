There's a pretty interesting startup called <a href="http://flocations.com/">Flocations</a>. They're a TechStar startup from Singapore. They allow you to visualize where you can fly to based on your departure airport, budget and dates. It's a travel inspiration tool similar to <a href="www.kayak.com/explore/">KAYAK Explore</a>, "see where you can go for how much". 

It's pretty neat but isn't really working for most airports. It's a good tool to use once they add more airports and make the flight searches more usable in terms of speed and bugs.
